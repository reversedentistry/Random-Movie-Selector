# Generating a Random To-Watch Movie List 

## Description
Ever wanted to watch a movie, but weren't sure of what to watch? With this app you can now pick from a selection of top-rated movies to create a to-watch list. The selections are drawn from the Top 250 Movies as rated on IMDB - simply open the link in a browser and click the "Get Movie" button. A random movie from the 250 will be displayed. If you like your selection, you can choose to save the movie to a list that is locally stored to be viewed later. 

If you aren't feeling so bold, there is a search bar below if you'd like more information on your selections. Just enter the name of the movie, and if the database can find it, it will display details such as rating, major cast members, plot, and more.
